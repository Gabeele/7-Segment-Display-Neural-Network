## Description
<p text-align="justify"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59030389/178108088-dea00ade-3577-46eb-a9ca-f2877b0d5179.png" width="150" align="right" />This project focuses on learning and building my skill set with Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN). It includes C++ code to outline a pretty basic NN using a specified amount of inputs, amount of hidden layers, and the amount of outputs. Once it is provided backpropergation, the NN will learn from the data given. The code only uses the STL making it easy, reliable, and portal. I built the UI using QT, but the code is segergated enough to use the NN files without the GUI.  The project simulates a single 7 segment display, each segment panel may have it's own brightness. For example, the number 2 may have a segment that is 100% brightness and another than is 65% brightness.Another example is 0 on a segmented display, light may leak into the middle segment creating an 8. This NN is trained to look for patterns and simularities in the numbers. Using the GUI users can set the brightness of each segment panel to create any numbers and the NN will perdict the number. Users can also tinker with the amount of Epoch's, seeing how the amount of learning will impacts the final result.</p>
